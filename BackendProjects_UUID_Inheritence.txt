Homework :
	Use @Inheritence and InheritenceType and try all 3 approaches.
	@DiscriminatorColumn with name and type
	Use @GeneratedValue = GenerationType= UUId

What is UUID ?
	-> Universal Unique Identifier.
	-> Generally we use int and long but even long might not suffice.
	Problems with Long id :
		-> In a very large application there might be several Dbs and using auto increment on long might lead to duplicate ids in seperate Dbs.
		-> Also, if the id is auto increment it is easier for hackers to try ids in loop for rest APIs and maybe also lead to DoS.
		
	Good thing wiht Long id :
		-> Easy to implement
		-> Size of key is small.
		
		
	-> If we use string, it is slower than long. but our DB converts it to Hexadecimal and stores in DB. Application side is alsways a String.
	
Inheritence in DBs :
	User {
	id,
	name, 
	password
}

	Mentor extends User{
		companyName
	}
	
	Instructor extends User{
		Rating
	}
	
	
How to store this in DB ?
	-> 1 .) Either keep 3 seperate table and each table has all colums
	   2.) Keep 1 user table that has all users and use id of that with mentor and instructor as a mapping.
	   3.) Keep all columns in 1 table and fill accordingly.
	   
	   No single best options
