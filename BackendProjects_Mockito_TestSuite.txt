Homework :
	-> Write test for user service
	-> Write test for product service

Mockito : 
	1.) For testing you don't want to depend on a dependency. You need to test each method on its own.
	2.) When using mockito in the test class. You create the response of all the dependencies you want to mock and then use mockito function. 
	 -> when(dependency is called).thenReturn(mocked dependency).
	-> Here the dependency in the method will be skipped and will be replaced by mocked dependency.
	
To test for functionality what is observed by client is tested by something called MVC test. 

	-> use MockMVC class object.
	-> user mockMVCObject.perform(get("Endpoint url of the method in the controller")).andExpect()
	
	
Test Suite is used to define set of test that need to be run to gether.
	-> Specific methods, classes or packages can be selected to be run.
	-> @Suite annotation is used.
