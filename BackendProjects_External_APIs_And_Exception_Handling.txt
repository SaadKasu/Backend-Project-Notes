Controller -> Service Layer.

Call external APIs in the service layer.

-> Jackson library is used that converts object to JSON and vice versa. We will need to serialize and deserialize the data we need to convert to JSON and vice versa.

-> Service layer is needed to execute logic and we need.

-> Now to create an object we will just use @Service in the service class and create a constructor in the controller class and passs object of product service in the class.
	-> Here using @Service tell spring to create oject of this special class.
	
-> Now to call to external API we first need to create DTOs for Request and Response.

-> Next we need to do an API call over the network. There are many libraries that can be used. Some are RestTemplate, HTTPClient, etc.

	-> We use RestTemplate here and need an object of RestTemplateBuilder like we created for service layer. using constructor.

	-> Here we use object of RestTemplateBuilder.build() to create a Resst Tempalate and using rest template use *ForEntity methods.

	-> This ForEntity methoidss return The object of DTO class wrapped in ResponseEntity Obejct.

	-> To create object of RestTemplateBuilder we need to tell spring that it is a bean class. Classes that are not defined by us we need to tell spring that objects to these classes need to be created. Use @bean to tell Spring this.

	-> Here RestTemplateBuilder is a Builder class on RestTempelate.


-> Dispatecher Servlet returns the status code.
	-> Success Response has range from 200-299 inclusive.
		-> Depending on the request we need to use different success status code.
			-> Like 204 is for when the request is successful(no error) but there is no data on the server.
			
-> TO return specific response from Controller.
	-> Here we use ResponseEntity wrapper and return responseEntity object with the specific HTTP sstatus.


-> To Send specific headers in the response.
	-> In the same responseEntity object we have other constructors that take in header also also with body and status code.
	-> Headers needs to be defined in multivalueMap.
	
-> To get a list of responses.
	-> All the steps till calling the getForEntity method are same.
	-> In the getForEntity method instead of just using the responsDTO classs we use responseDTO[].class. 
	-> Rest of the parameters are the same.
	-> This returns an array os ressponseDTOs that can be converted to List.
	
	
-> How to abstract out exceptions to not show it to client ?
	-> Exceptions are handled at controller level are controllers interacts with client and server.
	-> Implement a try catch and if exception is encountered return responseEntity object and return a HTTPstatus as 500. In the body we can pass any message that we want.
	
-> Data is transmitted and received in form of bytes but code understands classes. SO to convert that from one form to another Serialization and Deserializtion. 


-> Autowired supports inject on property, setter method and on constructor :	

	-> If setter method and property injection are used together setter method is used by spring. It is bad practive to use several inject methods in same class.
	
	-> Why constructor based inject is preffered ?
		-> All required dependencies are available at initialization time :
			-> If a constructor expects all requeired dependencies as parameters we can be 100% sure that class will never be instantiated without dependencies injected.
			-> This is useful to avoid null pointer exception.
		-> Allows us to see if our code is dependent on too many classes :
			-> If constructor requires too many paramneter then it might be time to refactor the code.
		-> Immutability :
			-> Constructor is the only way to create an object and once bean is created we cannot alter its dependencies. This is not the case with setter injection
			
			
-> What is a multivalueMap ?
	-> It allows to store key value pairs but 1 key can have zero or more values. it's not a 1 - 1 mapping. 
	-> In this we can have null as key and value too, which is not possible in normal maps.
	-> A multivalueMap decorates another map allowing it to have more than 1 value.
	-> Adding a value in the map  will add the value to a collection at that key and getting a value will return a collection holding all values put at that key.
	-> MultivalueMap is not syncronized and iss not thread safe.
	
-> What is Apache Tomcat ? 
	-> It is a web server and servlet container for Java code. It is a production ready tool.
